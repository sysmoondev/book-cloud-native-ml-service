# Detectron2 API in Your Code

See our [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16jcaJoc6bCFAQ96jDe2HwtXj7BMD\_-m5) to learn how to use detectron2 APIs to:

1. run inference with an existing model
2. train a builtin model on a custom dataset

See [detectron2/projects](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main/projects) for more ways to build your project on detectron2.
